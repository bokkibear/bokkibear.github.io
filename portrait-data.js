		description: "Emerging from a guerrilla war against the druids in the deepest wilds of [map:cornwall|Cornwall], Ailah Kerrow turned up quite uninvited to the great winter banquet of 1114, with demands that the warriors of Albion should turn their attention to helping her besieged people. Once Cornwall was liberated, it became clear that there was no home or family of hers left to return to, and the ranger found renewed purpose amongst the warhost.\n\nFiercely loyal to her friends and allies despite her somewhat blunt and often prickly nature, Ailah struggles to bridge the gap between the deeply traditional ways of Kernow and an ever-changing unified Albion.",

He left in 1106 and joined the crew of Captain Ramos, serving the Algaia as a battlefield reporter and front line warrior. However, Johnny’s hedonistic nature got him into trouble with the elves, and one night he was fired after almost killing an Estragalian priest in a drunken brawl.\n\nAs a parting gift, Captain Ramos helped Johnny recapture a foghouse from unscrupulous pirates. Johnny lived there quite happily for many years, earning a small stipend for keeping ships safe from the treacherous Needles. He now serves [gallery:cersei-de-vries|Queen Cersei] as a chronicler in her household guards and has earned the rank of Sergeant for his loyal service and excellent spelling.",
