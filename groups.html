					<h2>The Arcane Tempest</h2>
					<p>					
						In November of 1103 High Queen Elisabetta Trueheart signed into being the Arcane Tempest, giving right and title to Alistair Coleman-Gunn making him Lord General Gunn, caretaker of the Island of Santia and its 3 coastal forts.  All he had to do in return was maintain them, protect them and provide High Queen Trueheart with soldiers to be proud of.
					</p>

					<p>
						His years of battle had left Gunn tired of fragile bookish spellcasters and glory-hungry knights, and he sought instead magical talent that could be trained and disciplined as professional soldiers: taught to fight, run, cast, contribute, scout, skirmish, plan and above all get the job done and get out alive.  Scouring the land for talented magicians was not easy; it seems most would rather a comfortable library and their own room at a college over the barracks and marching that lay before them in Santia. But no stone was left unturned and as long as they had the talent and gave themselves over fully to their new family, the Tempest, then their history and birthrights ceased to matter.
					</p>

					<p>
						The Tempest were badly bloodied at the first <a href='albion-map.html#battle-of-polgooth'>battle of Polgooth</a>. It seemed a mortal blow that took years to recover from as many of their number laid down their lives for Albion, but the recruiting sergeants have been hard at work. The tricorns and long black coats of the Tempest are once again a common sight on battlefields all over the world, with ships and ritual mages ferrying them from conflict to conflict in the service of Lord General Gunn ,and once again their reputation grows throughout the lands of the allied nations.
					</p>

					<h2>Order of the Bear</h2>
					<p>					
						The Order of the Bear are Anglian Knights who serve King Quentyn Blackwell and the people of Anglia.
					</p>
					<p>
						Anglia is known for its fens and swamp lands and has remained largely populated by trolls who continue to cause problems, even after the death of Westwood. They now primary remain on the border.
					</p>
					<p>
						The Order's primary task is to protect and aid the local population, providing any and all support that they can. The Order is respected both for their martial prowess and their generosity. With peace across the land, the Order of the Bear travel to rejoin their King amongst the warhost.
					</p>
					<p>
						The Order is formed of both nobles and those raised to high station through noteworthy deeds and loyalty. The order is ever growing with knights, wizards and skilled crafters amongst the ranks.

					<h2>The Sovereign and Holy Order of the Knights Hospitaller of Damacest</h2>
					<p>					
						The Sovereign and Holy Order of the Knights Hospitaller are devoted to the goddess <a href='temple.html#damacest'>Damacest</a> and uphold her teachings of peace, healing and mercy in all their dealings. Members may follow either a spiritual or militant path, though all are either magical or surgical healers. They are oathsworn to heal any who need it, to protect innocents, to offer mercy to all and sanctuary to those unduly judged, and to seek peaceful resolution to all conflicts.

					<h2>Cast of Vengeance</h2>
					<p>					
						The Cast of Vengeance are an Order set up to follow the <a href='temple.html#solkar'>God of Righteous Vengeance, Solkar</a>.
					</p>				
					<p>
						They are a relatively new order and seek to bring Solkar to the forefront of the Warhost as it has been in the Past with the renowned Knights of Solkar. Solkar’s Vengeance should be considered and thoughtful in preparation and swift and efficient in action. Members of the order must constantly strive to seek out and assist people who seek Righteous Vengeance, whilst guarding against the burning passion and fiery rage which has the potential to consume their actions without Solkar's tempering hand.
					</p>
					<p>
						Led by a Chapter Master, beneath him is a council of 3 consisting of the Eyes, Talons and Wings of Vengeance who advise on matters for the Order.

					<h2>The Gathered Sentinels</h2>
					<p>
						<blockquote>
							Ever Watching, Ever Serving, Ever Guarding
						</blockquote>
					</p>
					<p>					
						Made up of a rag tag collection of those devoted to Albion, the Gathered Sentinels (or simply “Sentinels”) are dedicated to honing their skills and putting them to use as best they can for the good of Albion's people. After the sacrifice of his lifelong friend, Elaina Stone, in the service of Albion during the battles at the Renewal of Magic 1115, <a href='gallery.html#letholdus'>Letholdus Ward</a> sought out others who shared his fervour for the protection of Albion and the Gathered Sentinels were founded.
					</p>				
					<p>
						Members of the Sentinels do not necessarily share a common set of skills or even homelands, but instead are a versatile group with scouts, healers, knights and more from across the Ten Kingdoms. Most importantly, all share a desire to protect the people of Albion. This means that the Sentinels often fill various roles within the Warhost, both on and off the battlefield. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Currently, Sentinels founder Letholdus Ward holds the title of Tail of the Owl – not so much a traditional leader, but a guiding force and advisor for the other members. The other members of The Owls Parliament (those who hold great experience in various areas of skill) are <a href='gallery.html#jhorik'>Jhorik the Striped</a>, The Right Wing of the Owl (matters martial); Ser Galladon of Elmet, The Left Wing of the Owl (matters diplomatic); <a href='gallery.html#cale'></a>Calenandir Escantar</a>, Right Eye of the Owl (matters of scouting / intelligence) and <a href='gallery.html#rinoa'>Rinoa Harper</a>, Left Eye of the Owl (matters domestic / internal).

					<h2>Library of Norholt</h2>
					<p>					
						The Library of Norholt is perhaps the largest library in the world outside of Glaramara. Based within Norholt City, the library is Norholt's foremost organisation for learning and knowledge and the centre of magical and ritual ability within the new Kingdom. The library has a huge range of staff who cover all conceivable skillsets from masters of sword forms to book binders and archivists.
					</p>				
					<h4>The Retrieval and Creation Department</h4>
					<p>
						The Retrieval and Creation department of the library is made up of individuals who prefer their research to involve less sitting in the library and engaging with the world. These individuals record events as they transpire to be remembered for posterity. This department is also key in the uncovering of previously lost information for the library.
					</p>
					<p>
						This lends the RCD to being the department attached to the Lions Warhost as they are the most hands on part of the Library. Having begun sending a representative to nearby <a href='map.html#deira'>Deira</a> in the year 1117. The members of the library are known for getting involved with the solving of problems and giving helpful advice to the warhost.

					<h2>The Lance of Deira</h2>
					<p>					
						The Lance of Deira were forged in fire at the tail end of Maldred's reign of terror. From the burnt out homes and despoiled fields of <a href='albion-map.html#deira'>Deira</a>, the last shreds of the fighting men of a dozen lords and religious orders made their stand at Preston bridge.These men and women learned the hardest of lessons in that war, and any who meet them for but a mere moment would not perhaps understand that. From the outside they are jovial, rowdy, high spirited and at times uncouth. As the moon rises over the warhosts you will find them drunken, and in the arms of whatever companion they can find.
					</p>
					<p>
						Yet come the light of day, they are mighty warriors, their shields emblazoned with the burning bridge of Preston, and the armoured gauntlet that make up their resolve. As fiercely jovial as they can be they are fiercely loyal to each other and to the people of Albion. From within their ranks you will find the crudest of jokes and the noblest of hearts, and in their time with the warhost they have proven to have both.
					</p>
					<p>
						So be it fine drinking partners or a shield brother that you can depend on, you know where the Lance will be. With the Blue and Red colours stained in their enemies blood; over the hills and far away from Deira and the memories of their pain.
					</p>
					<p>
						Know their code, and you shall know them:
						<blockquote>
							I will defend the Lance: Come right, come wrong, come the combined forces of the factions, I will stand by my brothers in arms.<br/>
							I will keep my word: and do not give it lightly. What one of the Lance has promised, the others are bound by.<br/>
							I am not an assassin : Although my work involves death, I do not take coin purely to end the life of another.<br/>
							I am not a thief: I am a knight, not common soldiery. The plunder of war and the ransom of opponents is my domain, not theft.<br/>
							I will not sully my weapon: Anyone can swing a sword and cut another. I am not anyone. I will not strike an unarmed man with my blade.

					<h2>The Knights of the North</h2>
					<p>					
						The Knights of the North is an ancient order within Albion dedicated to protecting and serving the most remote and desolate regions of Albion. The Order is traditionally led by a knight from one of the northern noble houses and usually consists of variously skilled nobles, priests, magi, ritualists and common folk who are all sworn to a common cause. The Order is not ostensibly a religious one, but by tradition <a href='temple.html#draco'>Draco</a> is the patron God of the Order and in practice the Order very much requires obedience to the tenets of the Gods of Law from its members.
					</p>
					<p>					
						The Order serves as the High King's justice in the northern lands where the circuit courts travel but infrequently. Members of the Order can be appointed as sworn Truthsayers of Draco, bound by the Gods of Law themselves to utter no falsehood and bare all truths to the eyes of the Gods. The Order was first represented in the Warhost in the year 999 under the command of Duke Robert DeCourcey. The Duke was a renowned warrior who led the war host of Albion countless times. A Truthsayer and skilful diplomat, Robert was pivotal in ending hostilities between Albion and Norsca during the Trueheart reign. He fell leading the war host in battle in 1007.
					</p>
					<p>
						The Order's most renowned knight is Sir Giles DeVries. A lifelong friend of Lord Robert, St. Giles was canonised by the Church for his willing sacrifice to free the world from the blight of the Blood Queen.
					</p>
					<p>
						The current Grand Master of the Knights of the North is <a href='gallery.html#cersei-de-vries'>Queen Cersei de Vries</a>, Queen of <a href='albion-map.html#bernicia'>Bernicia</a>. Caledonian by birth, Cersei was Duke Robert's aunt by marriage and was granted lands and title in Albion by Sir Giles shortly before his death. She was subsequently anointed Queen of Bernicia under King Tristan's Restoration. An accomplished warrior and knight, she has served in the front line of the war host with the Knights of the North since 1001. A zealous devotee of Draco, she is a sworn Truthsayer.

					<h2>Peasants of Deira</h2>
					<p>					
						The Necromancer Maldred's war on <a href='albion-map.html#deira'>Deira</a> left many of the common folk destitute and homeless. In a war they could not fight, their only hope was to look to the woods for shelter and wait out the reign of destruction.
					</p>
					<p>					
						In the calm which followed the storm they began to emerge from their safe refuges and looked to the warhost to help give something back to the Albion who had sheltered them. Welcomed in by the newly appointed <a href='gallery.html#beaumont-trevallian'>King Beaumont of Deira</a>, the rag-tag assortment of peasants use their connection to the land and the common people to give what they can to their new Lord and the warhosts' cause, be it counsel, sustenance or cider.

					<p>					
						Caer Culhaven, whilst being the name of the central-most caer in Cornwall, home of the <i>carreg y brenin uchel</i>, is also the name taken by the survivors of the carnage witch Verlaine. Caer Culhaven are a traditional group of folk, with one foot firmly stuck in the past. There is a saying in their home country, "Cornwall remembers", and this is a saying to which they all hold true...
