			"description": "Bernicia is the northernmost kingdom of Albion - a wild, remote, harsh and largely uncivilized place, containing towering mountains, deep glens and dark forests. Beasts, bandits and evil monsters plague the wilderness, as well as ad hoc raids from across the border with Caledonia. Most settlements are fortified towns near the coast, and knightly orders have traditionally held great sway in providing protection for the local population.\n\nBernicia has since the time of High King Tristian been ruled by Queen Cersei de Vries, Grandmaster of the [group:knights-of-the-north|Knights of the North], an order dedicated to [temple:draco|Draco]. The queen has seen Albion change a great deal in this time but she has used her position to ensure the rule of law and justice sinks deep into her kingdom, leading to a renewed sense of binding purpose and fortitude in its people. Bernicia is experiencing a slow climb out of the darkness rather than the cyclical blossom and fall of its neighbor, [map:deira|Deira].\n\nBernicia has also had perhaps the longest standing and most visible presence in the warhost, encouraging those of other nations to join and make a name for their kingdoms.

			"description": "The rugged and rainy region of Norholt stood for many years as the only principality in the land. However, it has recently taken its place in the story of Albion, becoming a kingdom under the newly appointed Queen Elizabeth Yates. Not only does the fey Prince Greyhame, known as “The Wyvern”, continue to command influence and respect, many of the decisions for the direction of Norholt also go through the council of twelve Barons and it is no easy task to ensure they all see eye to eye.\n\nDue to the majority of Norholt being mountainous and populated by fantastical creatures, land is at a premium and as such the population is small, with only a few settlements and one major city - Norholt itself. Despite their nation’s small size, Norholtians are fiercely independent, hardworking and dutiful people - attributes that lend themselves to the quarrying and fishing trade from which the majority of Norholt’s wealth is derived. They are also very proud of the Library of Norholt, one of the foremost seats of learning in the known world.",

In the aftermath of this tragedy, the capital was moved to Preston – a city surging with life and bolstered by a refugee populace from across the continent.\n\nKing Beaumont has made some progress in returning peace and prosperity to the region - largely by re-establishing the rule of law and drawing the kingdom together once more. Recently, this too has been threatened by the re-emergence of an old ruler of Deira from the mists of Elvesham. Fortunately, it appears that the out-of-time Queen Matilda and the king have put aside their differences for the nation’s good.\n\nThere is some suggestion that the famine in [map:wessex|Wessex] has spread to Deira too.

			"description": "Anglia is a rich and bountiful land where farming and the natural cycle are incredibly important. The kingdom is known for its fens and swamplands, including a large troll population, split between three key tribes: The Temu, The Quassar and The Hachin. Although the trolls fought for the king during the recent fey wars, Anglia remains a kingdom divided between the staunchly conservative human courts and the wild fenlands of the trolls. Historically this situation has been exacerbated by harsh treatment and suspicion of the troll populace.\n\nBecause of its natural resources and geographical position, trade is the lifeblood of Anglia and it sells much of its produce across Albion. From outside perspectives the kingdom is sometimes considered rather staid and set in its ways, with a strong adherence to Albion’s feudal traditions, and power that has been passed between the same few families for generations. The populace are proud of their king, who also acts as hand to the High Monarch of Albion. ",

Ruled by Queen Esme, who is herself fond of courtly spectacle, Essex has become famous for lavish courtly events.\n\nWorship of the nine - of [temple:ranalf|Ranalf] and [temple:mithras|Mithras] alongside the gods of law - is also traditionally looked on with tolerance in Essex and Queen Esme has worked hard to win the hearts and minds of her subjects, despite being Wessex-born.\n\nHowever, shaken by tragedy in recent times, a rather sombre mood has descended on the populace, particularly after its sacrifices at the Siege of Maidenshead where many of Essex’s young men and women met their deaths. And betrayal also lingers in the air, with one of Essex’s two dukes recently tried, convicted and executed for treason against the land and her people.",

			"description": "The people of Sussex are still reeling from the shock abdication of the [gallery:benegar|legendary King Benegar], leaving the kingdom in the hands of King Luncan. It remains to be seen if he will find the same popularity and love among the people as Benegar - the man who once served as hand to the legendary High King Tristian.\n\nSussex is the religious heartland of Albion, and its people are often seen as dour and rather serious by outsiders. It has important centres in Wells and Winchester and within its borders sits the influential Grand Temple of Solkar, the fame of which has grown in recent years after many of its high profile templars attended the warhost.\n\nThe [group:hospitallers|Hospitallers of Damacest] have also made Sussex a centre of their efforts, bringing the healing arts into sharper focus within the kingdom. The land of Sussex can be harsh and unforgiving but its populace is practical and hard-working and it has therefore remained peaceful and comparatively prosperous in recent times.",

			"description": "Wessex has been a rich, powerful and populous region, at the centre of many of Albion’s trade routes. The city of London in particular is bustling and cosmopolitan. Its monarch, King Mourning, is primarily a military man and in recent years his focus on leading troops abroad and at home and his generosity to those in need, supporting [map:deira|Deira], [map:cornwall|Cornwall] and others, has led to a scarcity of food in what was the breadbasket of Albion.\n\nWessex is also perhaps the most progressive of Albion’s nations. The king has eschewed the traditional hereditary and feudal powers in favour of a more meritocratic approach - even raising talented peasants to high ranking positions. Unsurprisingly this has raised many eyebrows and caused some alarm amongst Wessex’s older families. Though strong historical ties to [map:oxford|Oxford] exist, the two nations have fallen out of late. But with famine abroad in Wessex, and Oxford one of the kingdoms offering aid, can these old wounds begin to heal?",

In his absence, the steward of his house has been performing admirably but matters are starting to fray – the normally stable politics have picked up pace, his people grow frustrated with his unexplained times away and the border with Anglia has become increasingly dangerous as that nation gradually expands its presence through armed patrols and reputed raiding.\n\nThere are mutterings too among the nobles of the land, who see the power vacuum that Gallad’s wanderings create.\n\nElmet is both feudal and highly religious - as reflected by its monarch’s own attitudes - and it holds the old ways and customs in high regard.",

However, following the defeat of the druids of the old religion, the kingdom is enjoying closer relations with the rest of Albion than ever before.\n\nStill very much ravaged by recent wars, King Leofric, one time hero of the warhost has a significant job to do in terms of rebuilding and re-establishing Cornwall. And though things are slowly changing, Cornwall remains the most superstitious and insular of all the kingdoms, with its own titles and positions, including thegn and shire-reeve. Cornishmen are often seen as backward and dour and are still very tribal the further you travel from the border– for example, witches and wisemen are known and valued rather than shunned and bread and milk are left on the hearth for nixies. With mining (especially tin) and fishing as its main industries, and with the High Monarch himself Cornish by birth, perhaps Cornwall is entering a period of brighter fortunes.",

			"description": "Oxford was once the seat of the rulers of Albion, though after the return of High King Tristian and his successors, this tradition was broken – to the chagrin of the Crown Council of Oxford. Currently the inscrutable Earl Hawksmoor acts as regent for the nation, overseeing its recovery after the recent ravages of the fey war. Although she has generally good relations with the other rulers of Albion, the wars have left deep scars - and not just those that are physical in nature.\n\nThere is also historical antagonism between Oxford and [map:wessex|Wessex], with the former refusing to open its borders to Wessex troops marching to [map:cornwall|Cornwall] during the war with Artur.\n\nThe kingdom is a highly civilised and cultured region of Albion, especially with Oxford University, the eminent centre of learning and strong links to the elven folk of Elvesham. And of course, nobody does courtly tradition and intrigue like Oxford - it takes its historical rituals and customs very seriously indeed, causing accusations of pomposity and arrogance from outsiders.",
