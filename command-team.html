					The Lions Command Structure are here to help all our players both in and out of character to enjoy the world of Curious Pastimes (CP). Out Of Character (OOC), here are some of the things Lions Command are responsible for:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Getting the faction kit (tents, gate, banner walls, tankards, etc) to and from the events.</li>
					<li>Setting up and taking down the Lions camp.</li>
					<li>Liaising with the CP Game Team (refs, monsters, world plot) and CP Event Team (OOC logistics, safety and campsite liaisons).</li>
					<li>Refereeing the game and answering player questions in the Lions camp (ably assisted by our excellent Lions Faction Refs).</li>
					<li>Administering faction funds.</li>
					<li>Arranging banquet and faction events.</li>
					<li>Herding cats.</li>
					<li>Ensuring the Lions camp and player experience is as excellent as possible!</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					In Character (IC), Lions Command are the leaders of the land of Albion and the commanders of that nation's armies and can help with any important issues. The current Lions Command set up is as follows:
				</p>
			</div>
			<ul class='bio-list'>
				<li>
					<img src='portraits/Matthew-Bradford.PNG' height=128 width=128 />
					<h2><span class='acronym' title='1st In Command'>1IC</span>: Matthew 'Milkybar' Bradford</h2>
					<h3><span class='acronym' title='2nd In Command'>In character 2IC</span>: <a href='gallery.html#quentyn-blackwell'>King Quentyn Blackwell of Anglia, Duke of Norwich, Warden of the East, Hand of the King.</a></h3>
					<p>
						Matt's been playing this game for well over ten years and even met his beautiful wife in the tavern at an event. He considers having a famous song written about one of his characters, Sir Cadawyr, his greatest LARP achievement. Good for unrealistic ideas and trying to form order out of chaos - somehow now in charge!
					</p>
					<p>
						King Quentyn was raised to royalty against his wishes by High Queen Graziella in 1016 though spends little time in his home nation due to the demands of the warhost.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src='portraits/Dave-McKenna.PNG' height=128 width=128 />
					<h2><span class='acronym' title='2nd In Command'>2IC</span>: Dave 'FNG' McKenna</h2>
					<h3><span class='acronym' title='1st In Command'>In character 1IC</span>: <a href='gallery.html#rudraigh'>High King Rudraigh Penhaligon, Hier Thegn of Caer Culhaven.</a></h3>
					<p>
						Has there been a time at CP before Dave was there? Well not really as he had been a player for almost 3 whole main events before joining the ref crew, from there to command team in the Algaia, then retiring to play in the Lions. Unable to stay away from helping run the game he has come back to the fold. Shy, quiet and understated - these are words that Dave has heard said about others but rarely about himself and his mandate is to bring law, chaos and most importantly GAMES to Albion.
					</p>
					<p>
						Rudraigh came second in the most curmudgeonly person in Cornwall competition. Rumour has it he threw the competition, so he could passively aggressively complain about not winning. He was given his Excalibur by Genevieve on the Isle of Anwyn in the spring of 1018.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<img src='portraits/Neil-Payne.PNG' height=128 width=128 />
					<h2><span class='acronym' title='3rd In Command'>3IC</span>: Neil 'Special Bus' Payne</h2>
					<h3><span class='acronym' title='3rd In Command'>3IC</span>: <a href='gallery.html#pellinore'>Ser Pellinore, Knight Feudal.</a></h3>
					<p>
						Nelly has been part of the Lions longer than pretty much anyone and rumours abound that he was born under the round table. He's been a faction ref for over 10 years and despite holidaying for two years on the game team in 2015 has resumed his position as part of the furniture.
					</p>
					<p>
						Ser Pellinore joined the warhost from his native Elmet in 1016, disdaining the life of a questing knight to serve the warhost.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<div class='intro-blurb'>
				<h3>Faction Referees</h3>
				<p>The Command Team couldn’t run the faction without help and support and for that we have an excellent crew of “faction refs” who assist by:</p>
				<ul>	
					<li>Running faction monster slots.</li>
					<li>Contributing to plot ideas.
					<li>Refereeing the game and answering player questions in the Lions camp.
					<li>Generally pitching in whenever Faction Command need help.
				</ul>
				<p>Our current Faction Referees are:</p>
				<ul>								
					<li>Baz Robinson</li>
					<li>Sara Law</li>
					<li>Matt Isherwood</li>
					<li>John C Kirk</li>
					<li>Sam Merry</li>
				</ul>
